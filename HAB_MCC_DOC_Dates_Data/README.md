# Explaining the Data

This repository is dedicated for the data received from the Maritime monitoring authority.
The entries include:
- SET_DATE: Date when the data was collected
- LON_START: The Longitude associated with the data in World Geodetic System 1984, WGS 84
- LAT_START: The Latitude  associated with the data in World Geodetic System 1984, WGS 84.
- SPECIES: The Fish Species, in Scientific Nomencaluture under study associated with the environonmental conditions of that location.
- T_LENGTH(CM): The metric measusrements of the species, in Centimetres
- S_LENGTH(CM): The metric measusrements of the species, in Centimetres
- F_LENGTH(CM): The metric measusrements of the species, in Centimetres
- WEIGHT (GMs): The metric weight of the species caught
- HAB Observed (Boolean): Whether or not Hamful Algae blooms were reported or physically observed by the Maritime & Environment body. 
- Chl-a Level Recorded (mg/m3): The quantified Chlorophyll-a recorded, monitored in mg/m3 of Water collected in the Spatial area under observation.
- Lake Surface Air Temp (Deg. Cel): The recorded Lake Surface Air Temperature(LSAT) in Degrees Celcius in the Spatial location under observation.
- Dissolved Organic Content (mg/L): The quantified Dissolved Organic Content (Organic molecules, Algae, decayed plant material, microorganisms) recorded, in mg/L of Water collected in the Spatial area under observation.
- Microcystin Aeruginosa (MCC, ug/L): The potent hepatotoxins produced by cynobacteria bloom-forming species in fresh water bodies like Lake Victoria, recorded, micrograms(u)/L of Water collected in the Spatial area under observation.

## Other Raster Data
- Other Spatial data comprising of remote sensed Landsat 8 (OLI & TIR) & Sentinel 3, OLCI Raster images were acquired of the reported dates, sequentially under study.
- Given their vast qunatities, they are not easily re-sharable.
